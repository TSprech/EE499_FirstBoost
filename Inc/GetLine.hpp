/**
 * @brief Reads a line from the USB serial port without blocking.
 * @warning This function does not guarantee a line has been read as it can timeout. Check the returned iterator against the beginning of the buffer to see if valid data has been read.
 * @code {.cpp}
 * auto str = GetLine(buf);
 *   if (!in_str.empty()) {
 *     // Code dealing with the string here

 * @endcode
 * @param buffer A char buffer which will be used to read in the characters and which the returned string_view is based on.
 * @param eol_indicator The character that indicates the end of a line, data is read until this is reached.
 * @param timeout_us The amount of time to wait for a character, in Âµs, before concluding no data is available and moving on.
 * @param echo If true, the characters read in will be printed back to the console as they are processed.
 * @returns A string view representing the data that has been read in.
